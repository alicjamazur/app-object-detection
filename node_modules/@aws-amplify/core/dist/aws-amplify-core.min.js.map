 <p>Amazon Cognito Federated Identities is a web service that delivers scoped temporary\n *          credentials to mobile devices and other untrusted environments.

also choose to support unauthenticated access from your app.\n *          Cognito delivers a unique identifier for each user and acts as an OpenID token provider\n *          trusted by AWS Security Token Service (STS) to access temporary, limited-privilege AWS\n *          credentials.</p>\n *          <p>For a description of the authentication flow from the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide\n *
